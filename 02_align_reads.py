These determine how statistics are collected when the --stats parameter is set.
The output will be in CSV format with three elements per row:

* The first number is a quality threshold (n / 10 gives the negative log probability
of a sequencing error).
* The second number is the number of bases that are allowed to fall below the
quality threshold.

tolerance.
